    "I read a lot of books and recently started reading; The Kite Runner, by Khaled Hosseini. This inspired me to create a book club newsletter, as a way to inspire more people to read books, tell the stories of the authors and discover their inspiration that led them to write the book.<br>Another inspiration, was the Guardian Book club Newsletter, the newsletter provides subscribers with content on authors, books and cultural content. I found it to be a great way to obtain information on new books that I can read, find out how authors got inspired to write. <br> The author Haruki Murakami, is another reason that I created a book club based newsletter. His book Norwegian Wood, is a book that I adore and love, this newsletter is a way for me to express my love for the author and his book.<br><br>" + "I made sure my website is accessible through the use of the most suitable html tags that describe the content being inputted, such as using h1 tags for titles, p tags for main content and figure tags for images. The Images also have appropriate alternate attributes, that will, be displayed incase the image in question does not load. I also used colors sparsely and used only certain type of colors, as there is a chance that a color blind user may access my site.  <br><br>" + "I considered the various types of users that could possibly use the site, such as blind users, they would use a screen readers in order to navigate my website, so i included semantic tags that will make much more user-friendly for them. I also made sure that the website is entirely useable through only using the keyboard. I also considered the various types of devices that users may access the site from, so the website is dynamic and will change the content size, based on the user's device.<br><br>" + "I learned how to use jQuery while designing the webpage, to make it more interactive and dynamic. I had to learn the syntax for it and learn how to traverse the Document Object Model(DOM) in order to access specific elements. Another thing, I learned was to pre-compile handlebar templates, to be used in my website. The articles for my website, have the same DOM and layout, thus pre-compiling a standard layout allowed me to use it through all the webpages rather than create one for each page, which allowed me to reduce the amount of code and lines. It also allows me to make changes to all 5 articles, in one go rather than 5 times. I also learnt, how to add icons to my navigation bar, without touching my main html files. As the icons are only used in the navigation bar, one line allowed me to add it to all webpages rather than adding the CSS import link to every page.<br><br>" + "I think that I have done a good job in combining the various JavaScript libraries available, to create a website that can be reused by other developers. Various sections of the website's HTML, JavaScript, CSS and Handlebar files are sectioned off, neatly such that, anyone can change the content without having the technical skills required to create a full website.<br><br> " + "I feel that I could improve on the legibility of my content, that is being added into my webpages. As they seem very messy and hard to traverse. If I were to create a webpage again, I would break up the content further into smaller parts, that have a good labelling such that anyone who looks at it will know which part of the content it is part of.<br><br>" + "I used multiple sources of code and information to achieve my intended website. Bootstrap was used in-order to create a dynamic layout for my webpage that would adjust itself based on the user's viewing device and to also section off parts of the DOM for each element of the website.<br>Handlebars, was used to create to template my webpage and pre-compile it. It allowed me to create a single template to be used across multiple pages and also reduce the amount of HTML code used in the main HTML file.<br>I also used jQuery, to create a interactive form that accepts user input and responds to it.",
