        <h1>Individual Project Report</h1>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          The story being told by my site, is of the authors and is intended to interest people who would like to learn about the process of creating a book. What inspired authors to write the books they did and their thought process. It is designed in a newsletter structure, as it is intended for specific kind of audience.
        </p>
        <h3>State 3 things that have inspired you when creating your website.</h3>
        <p>
          I read a lot of books and recently started reading; The Kite Runner,
          by Khaled Hosseini. This inspired me to create a book club newsletter,
          as a way to inspire more people to read books, tell the stories of the
          authors and discover their inspiration that led them to write the
          book.<br><br>Another inspiration, was the Guardian Book club Newsletter,
          the newsletter provides subscribers with content on authors, books and
          cultural content. I found it to be a great way to obtain information
          on new books that I can read, find out how authors got inspired to
          write.<br><br>
          The author Haruki Murakami, is another reason that I created a book
          club based newsletter. His book Norwegian Wood, is a book that I adore
          and love, this newsletter is a way for me to express my love for the
          author and his book. While in process find out more about his inspiration in writing the book.
        </p>
        <h3>State 3 ways in which your site is accessible.</h3>
        <p>
          I made sure my website is accessible through the use of the most
          suitable html tags that describe the content being inputted, such as
          using h1 tags for titles, p tags for main content and figure tags for
          images. <br><br>The Images also have appropriate alternate attributes, that
          will, be displayed incase the image in question does not load. <br><br>I also
          used colors sparsely and used only certain type of colors, as there is
          a chance that a color blind user may access my site.
        </p>
        <h3>State 3 ways in which you have considered usability in your site.</h3>
        <p>
          I considered the various types of users that could possibly use the
          site, such as blind users, they would use a screen readers in order to
          navigate my website, so i included semantic tags that will make much
          more user-friendly for them.<br><br> I also made sure that the website is
          entirely useable through only using the keyboard and that it is also usable through a touch screen device.<br><br> I also considered
          the various types of devices that users may access the site from, so
          the website is dynamic and will change the content size, based on the
          user's device.
        </p>
        <h3>State 3 things you had to learn/find out by yourself when creating your site, and describe
          how you did that </h3>
        <p>
          I learned how to use jQuery while designing the webpage, to make it
          more interactive and dynamic. I had to learn the syntax for it and
          learn how to traverse the Document Object Model(DOM) in order to
          access specific elements.<br><br> Another thing, I learned was to pre-compile
          handlebar templates, to be used in my website. The navigation bar and footer are the same throughout all my web pages, thus I learnt how to use a pre-compiled handlebar template so that, 1 template will be used across all the pages, which allowed me to reduce the lines of code and also make changes simultaneously across all the webpages in one go. <br><br>I also learnt, how to add icons to my
          navigation bar, without touching my main html files. As the icons are
          only used in the navigation bar, one line allowed me to add it to all
          webpages rather than adding the CSS import link to every page.
        </p>
        <h3>What aspect(s) of your work do you think worked well and why?</h3>
        <p>
          I think that I have done a good job in combining the various
          JavaScript libraries available, to create a website that can be reused
          by other developers. Various sections of the website's HTML,
          JavaScript, CSS and Handlebar files are sectioned off, neatly such
          that, anyone can change the content without having the technical
          skills required to create a full website.
        </p>
        <h3>What aspect(s) of your work could be improved, and how might you do things differently
          another time?</h3>
        <p>
          I feel that I could improve on the legibility of my content, that is
          being added into my webpages. As they seem very messy and hard to
          traverse. If I were to create a webpage again, I would break up the
          content further into smaller parts, that have a good labelling such
          that anyone who looks at it will know which part of the content it is
          part of.
        </p>
        <h3>What resources were used when creating your work?</h3>
        <p>
          I used multiple sources of code and information to achieve my intended
          website. <br><br>Bootstrap was used in-order to create a dynamic layout for my
          webpage that would adjust itself based on the user's viewing device
          and to also section off parts of the DOM for each element of the
          website.<br />Handlebars, was used to create to template my webpage
          and pre-compile it. It allowed me to create a single template to be
          used across multiple pages and also reduce the amount of HTML code
          used in the main HTML file.<br />I also used jQuery, to create a
          interactive form that accepts user input and responds to it.<br><br> I used a resource called Mockflow to create the wireframes and mockups which allowed me to visualize it before fully implementing it.
